## üöÄ Overview

This contract enables open, transparent, and democratic funding for research projects.  
Participants can:

- üí∞ **Contribute ETH** to the common research pool.  
- üßæ **Create Proposals** requesting funding for research ideas.  
- üó≥Ô∏è **Vote** on proposals (based on contribution weight).  
- üí∏ **Execute** approved proposals that meet quorum and majority.  
- üîô **Withdraw** their unused contributions anytime.

## üìú Core Features

### üè¶ Contribution
Anyone can contribute ETH to the fund by calling:
```solidity
function contribute() external payable;
````

or simply by sending ETH directly to the contract address.

### üßë‚Äçüî¨ Proposal Creation

Only contributors can create funding proposals:

```solidity
function createProposal(string memory title, address payable beneficiary, uint256 amount);
```

### üó≥Ô∏è Voting

Each contributor can vote (Yes/No) once per proposal.
Voting weight = ETH contributed.

### üíº Execution

After the voting window (3 days), anyone can execute a proposal:

```solidity
function executeProposal(uint256 proposalId);
```

If quorum (10%) and majority are met, funds are released to the beneficiary.

### üí∏ Withdraw Contributions

Contributors can withdraw their funds:

```solidity
function withdrawContribution(uint256 amount);
```

## üß™ Testing & Usage

### Deploy Locally (Remix or Hardhat)

1. Open Remix IDE ‚Üí paste the contract code.
2. Compile using **Solidity 0.8.19**.
3. Deploy without constructor parameters.
4. Interact via the Remix interface or a Web3 frontend.

### Example Commands (Remix / Web3)

* Contribute: `contribute()` or send ETH directly.
* Create Proposal: `createProposal("AI Research", 0xBeneficiary, 1000000000000000000)`
* Vote: `vote(0, true)`
* Execute: `executeProposal(0)`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes

* Not audited (use for learning/demo only).
* Votes depend on live contributions (no snapshot).
* Reentrancy-safe for ETH sends via `call`, but audits recommended before mainnet use.
* Always test on testnet first!
